# Canned Responses Browser Extension

That's right, yet another canned responses browser extension! The majority of the options on the market are closed source and require you to pay for subscriptions or impose incredibly restrictive limitations. They also are often not as powerful as they could be. The goal of this application is to allow saving canned responses. Each canned response can be tied to a specific set of website, or defined for global use on any website. Additionally you can choose to store things only locally, or you can choose to have your data synced with Google Drive. Should you choose Google Drive, it will sync your canned responses when you make any changes, as well as on browser launch. Additionally it will check for any updates every hour, with an option to force a resync.

You can interact with the canned responses via a fancy browser extension pop-up menu, as well as via your browsers right-click context menus.

Some sites allow rich html content, as such this extension also supports either saving a canned response as plain text, or as HTML with a nice WYSWIG editor to help formulate a canned message.
